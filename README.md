# impracto-sense
This is my first Ardunio based project where I have used 3 sensors to provide a solution for both day and night.This module can be implemented in vehicles.
There are 3 sensors: an LDR , a TMP36 temperature sensor and an ultrasonic distance sensor. The working of the module changes during the day and during the night.
During the day the LDR senses the light and activates the temprature sensor which can tell us how cold or hot it is.
During the night the LDR senses that there is absence of light and then activates the ultrasonic distance sensor which measures the if the object is too close and if it is the buzzer rings.
